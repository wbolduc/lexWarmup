   This directory contains all the required files for building a scanner 
for the Tiny language.  

   To build the scanner, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "scanner".

   To test source code like "gcd.tiny", type "./scanner < gcd.tiny" and 
the token sequence will be displayed on the screen.

   To rebuild the scanner, type "make clean" and type "make" again.
