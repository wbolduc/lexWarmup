This directory contains all the required files for building a scanner for the SGML formatted text.  

To build the scanner, type "make" in the current directory, which will generate an executable program called "scanner".

To scan text, after building, type "./scanner < your_file" (where your_file is the name of your file to scan). Optionally you can capture output by piping it to another file.
	eg. "./scanner < your_file > output_file"

To rebuild the scanner, type "make clean" and type "make" again.
